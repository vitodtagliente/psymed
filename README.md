## Project Description

Psymed is a powerful Node.js application designed to streamline the analysis of medical documents. It intelligently **reads medical texts**, identifies and **extracts key entities** like medical problems, and then uses this information to **generate a BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale)**. This automation helps in quickly synthesizing crucial patient data, aiding medical professionals in their assessment and documentation processes.
